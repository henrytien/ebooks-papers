### NoSQL
* [Redis in Action](https://github.com/henrytien/HenryBooks/blob/master/ebooks/Redis%20in%20Action.pdf)  
  Redis in Action introduces Redis and the key-value model. You'll quickly dive into real use cases including simple caching, distributed ad targeting, and more. You'll learn how to scale Redis from small jobs to massive datasets and discover how to integrate with traditional RDBMS or other NoSQL stores.
### Games
* [Beginning_Cpp_Through_Game_Programming](https://github.com/henrytien/ebooks-papers/blob/master/ebooks/Beginning_Cpp_Through_Game_Programming.pdf)  
This book is for anyone who wants to program games. It’s aimed at the total
beginner and assumes no previous programming experience. If you’re comfortable using your computer, then you can start your game programming odyssey
right here. But just because this book is written for the beginner, that doesn’t
mean learning Cþþ and game programming will be easy. You’ll have to read,
work, and experiment. By the end of this book, you’ll have a solid foundation in
the game programming language of the professionals.  


## Papers

### Algorithm
* [skiplists](https://github.com/henrytien/ebooks-papers/blob/master/papers/skiplists.pdf)   
  Skip lists are a data structure that can be used in place of balanced trees. Skip lists use probabilistic balancing rather than strictly enforced balancing and as a result the algorithms for insertion and deletion in skip lists are much simpler and significantly faster than equivalent algorithms for balanced trees.
