### NoSQL
* [Redis in Action](https://github.com/henrytien/HenryBooks/blob/master/ebooks/Redis%20in%20Action.pdf)  
  Redis in Action introduces Redis and the key-value model. You'll quickly dive into real use cases including simple caching, distributed ad targeting, and more. You'll learn how to scale Redis from small jobs to massive datasets and discover how to integrate with traditional RDBMS or other NoSQL stores.


## Papers

### Algorithm
* [skiplists](https://github.com/henrytien/ebooks-papers/blob/master/papers/skiplists.pdf) 
  Skip lists are a data structure that can be used in place of balanced trees. Skip lists use probabilistic balancing rather than strictly enforced balancing and as a result the algorithms for insertion and deletion in skip lists are much simpler and significantly faster than equivalent algorithms for balanced trees.
